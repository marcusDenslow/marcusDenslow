Hi there, I'm Marcus Denslow 👋
🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Systems Programmer and Computational Physics Enthusiast studying IT at Skien Videregående Skole in Norway. I love building low-level tools, exploring the intersection of physics and code, and creating efficient terminal applications that solve real problems.

    🔭 I'm currently working on advanced shell features and physics simulations
    🌱 I'm currently learning Zig and diving deeper into systems programming
    👯 I'm looking to collaborate on open source CLI tools and scientific computing projects
    💬 Ask me about C programming, terminal applications, physics simulations, or Norwegian tech scene
    📫 How to reach me: [your.email@example.com]
    ⚡ Fun fact: I built my own shell from scratch with autocompletion!

💻 What Makes Me Unique

Systems Programming Enthusiast - I enjoy working close to the metal, understanding how computers actually work, and building tools that interact directly with the operating system.

Physics Meets Code - My passion for physics drives me to create simulations and numerical solutions that bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementations.

Tool Builder - Rather than just using existing tools, I love building my own versions to understand the underlying principles (hence the custom shell and git client).

Language Explorer - Always excited to learn new programming languages, especially systems languages like Zig that push the boundaries of performance and safety.

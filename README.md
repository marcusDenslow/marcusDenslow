    Key Features: Autocompletion, Command suggestions, Built-in commands, History management
    Impact: Demonstrates deep understanding of system calls, process management, and user interaction design
    Learning: Advanced C programming, UNIX system programming, terminal I/O

⚡ Lazygit Clone

A primitive but functional version of lazygit built entirely in C using ncurses

    Tech Stack: C, ncurses, Git integration
    Key Features: Terminal UI for Git operations and Commit, branch, stash, file management
    Impact: Complex terminal UI programming showcasing ncurses mastery
    Learning: Advanced terminal programming, Git internals, UI/UX design for CLI tools
    --Part of the custom shell project

🌌 N-Body Physics Simulation

Numerical solution for 3-body and n-body gravitational problems

    Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, Numerical methods
    Key Features: Gravitational dynamics simulation and Visualization
    Impact: Applied computational physics to solve complex mathematical problems
    Learning: Numerical analysis, Physics simulation, Algorithm optimization



🎓 Education

IT Program - Skien Videregående Skole, Skien, Telemark, Norway (Current)

    Primary Focus: Computational Physics & Problem Solving

    Project-based Python programming for physics simulations and numerical methods
    Implemented solutions for complex problems like n-body gravitational systems
    Applied Euler's method for modeling real-world scenarios (water level calculations in leaking tank systems)
    Emphasis on translating mathematical concepts into efficient code
    
    Secondary Focus: Practical Engineering & IoT Systems
    
    Full-stack engineering projects combining software, electronics, and physical design
    Major Project: Environmental monitoring station deployed at a local bog collecting important data about 
    hydrological conditions -- results handed to norwegian government to argue against removal of the bog to
    accomodate for new buildings.                         
    
    //Update: Sucessful! 
    based on our results the bog was deemed likely to complete an autonomous restoration and therefore the 
    building plans were cancelled.

    
    Designed and built weather-resistant enclosure and mounting system
    Programmed Arduino sensors in C for data collection (water height, temperature, humidity)
    Engineered wireless data transmission system to remote database
    Implemented redundant manual data backup systems for reliability
    Integrated hardware design, embedded programming, and systems engineering



    Skills Developed: Python scientific computing, Arduino/C embedded programming, sensor integration, 
    database connectivity, physical prototyping, and interdisciplinary     problem-solving



💻 What Makes Me Unique

Systems Programming Enthusiast - I enjoy working close to the metal, understanding how computers actually work, and building tools that interact directly with the operating system.

Physics Meets Code - My passion for physics drives me to create simulations and numerical solutions that bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementations.

Tool Builder - Rather than just using existing tools, I love building my own versions to understand the underlying principles (hence the custom shell and git client).

Language Explorer - Always excited to learn new programming languages, especially systems languages like Zig that push the boundaries of performance and safety.
